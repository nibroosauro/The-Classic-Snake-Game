# Snake Game in C++ 🐍

Welcome to my first programming project! 🎉 This is a simple Snake game implemented in C++.

## Overview
This project is a basic implementation of the classic Snake game, where the player controls a snake to collect food and grow in length while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. This project helped me learn the fundamentals of C++ and game development.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay
- Simple controls
- Score tracking by snake's length

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 🛠️
To compile and run the Snake game, you will need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion)
